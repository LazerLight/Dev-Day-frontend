## Ironhack Project #3
From March to June 2018 I attended a **Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp** in Paris with [Ironhack](http://www.ironhack.com/en).

The program was very dense yet well structured and I learnt the following tech stack & tools:
- Angular 5
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express.js
- Javascript & Typescript
- HTML 5 / CSS 3
- GitHub
- Bash CLI

Dev Day is the second of three projects I did during the bootcamp. It was created with my fellow Ironhackers @LazerLight and @LPsola, hope you enjoy it!


### [>>Here's the app!](https://dev-day33.herokuapp.com/)


## Context
The 3rd project happened after five weeks of learning. At this point, we had covered:
- advanced HTML 5 & CSS 3 manipulation, some animations
- advanced JS manipulations
- various APIs integration (Google Maps, Trello, GitHub, etc.)
- Handlebars
- Heroku app hosting platform
- front-end stack:
  - Angular.io (latest version)
  - front and back-end connection
- back-end stack:
  - Node.js 
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB
  - Mongoose

The insctructions were to create an app that would:
- involve as much as possible the technologies learnt so far
- actually be useful :)


## What is the app about?
By the end of the bootcamp we realized us developers actually have (at least) two jobs:
1. actually do what we do, which is writing code and making incredible products
2. working in teams with other developers, and actually organize so we don't cross each others or break somebody's work

Those two main jobs, combined, actually require us to use a big bunch of apps and services to stay updated and in sync. Juggling through them all could quickly become confusing.

### This is why we created Dev Day
Dev Dav is an app that basically brings together Trello and GitHub to provide you with the most important information from both platforms. 


## How does the tech work under the hood?

Hope you enjoyed using it, and don't hesitate to give me any (constructive) feedback!
