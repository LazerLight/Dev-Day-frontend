## Ironhack Project #3
From March to June 2018 I attended a **Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp** in Paris with [Ironhack](http://www.ironhack.com/en).

The program was very dense yet well structured and I learnt the following tech stack & tools:
- Angular 5
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express.js
- Javascript & Typescript
- HTML 5 / CSS 3
- GitHub
- Bash CLI

Dev Day is the second of three projects I did during the bootcamp. It was created with my fellow Ironhackers @LazerLight and @LPsola, hope you enjoy it!

- front-end stack:
  - Angular.io (latest version)
  - front and back-end connection
- back-end stack:
  - Node.js 
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB
  - Mongoose

The insctructions were to create an app that would:

- actually be useful :)
